	<center><h1>Software</h1></center>
	<p><b>Software</b> is a set of computer programs and associated documentation and data.1<sup>st</sup> This is in contrast to hardware, from which the system is built and which actually performs the w<sub>or</sub>k.

At the <i>lowest programming level</i>, executable code consists of <strong>machine language</strong> instructions supported by an individual processor—typically a central processing unit (CPU) or a <u>graphics processing unit (GPU)</u>. Machine language consists of groups of binary values signifying processor instructions that change the state of the <small>computer</small> from its <big>preceding state</big>. For example, an instruction may change the value stored in a particular storage location in the computer—an effect that is not directly observable to the user. An <bdo>instruction</bdo> may also invoke one of many input or output operations, for example, displaying some text on a computer screen, causing state changes that should be visible to the user. <em>The processor executes the instructions in the order they are provided</em>, unless it is instructed to <mark>jump</mark>to a different instruction or is interrupted by the <font size="5">operating system</font>. As of 2023, most personal computers, smartphone devices, and servers have processors with multiple execution units, or multiple processors performing computation together, so <del>computing</del> has become a much more concurrent activity than in the past.</p>
